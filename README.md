# Algorithm Validation and Testing Framework

This repository contains:
- A brute force solution
- An optimized solution
- A test generation script for algorithm validation

---

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to validate the correctness and efficiency of an optimized algorithm by comparing it against a brute force solution. Using a test generator, a wide variety of test cases can be created to ensure robustness.
